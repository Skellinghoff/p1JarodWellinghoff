## Old Interface
![Microwave Interface](https://i.imgur.com/Ujnn5w9.jpg?1)

This interface has a total of 31 buttons, only about half of them are used frequently.Notice the 6 darker buttons just under the LCD display. No one in the house has ever used these buttons - except the "popcorn" button, which undercooks the popcorn and does not allow the user to add anymore cook time.
