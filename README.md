# Old Microwave

## Old Interface

Starting from the top, the LCD display is very limited in the amount of information is can display to the user. When using certain functions that require multiple button presses the user has to wait for the display to scroll through several menu options. The display also does not tell the user what the options are for some functions, like the reheat function for example.

The options are displayed on a sticker that is visable when the door is open, but a first time user might not think they would have to open the door in order to learn how to operate the microwave.

The microwave will also start without asking the user for any confirmation of their choice. There is no way to go back to the selection menu, say by pressing the "Stop" button, if the user accidentally chooses the wrong option. 

This interface has a total of 31 buttons, only about half of them are used frequently. Notice the 6 darker buttons just under the LCD display. No one in the house has ever used these buttons - except the "popcorn" button, which undercooks the popcorn and does not allow the user to add anymore cook time.

The custom button has no explaination unless the owner's manual is present, which isn't very likely as this microwave came with the house and no one knows where it is. 

The button layout is servicable, but is unconvintional at best. If some of the more unneccessary buttons were removed, a more widely used pattern of having 3 columns could be used.

The "Light Timer" and "Light Hi/Lo/Off" have never worked and no one is sure if they are referring to the ligh on the inside of the microwave or a light underneath the machine. "Light Timer" also brings up a very confusing menu that is difficult to navigate.

The vent is neccessary as this microwave is above a stove/oven, but the 5 speeds seems like overkill. 

# Common and Rare Uses
## Common
1. Defrosting chicken
2. Heating up food for a specific time
3. Adding 30 seconds to cook time
4. Using the vent while cooking on the stove
5. Kitchen timer

## Rare
1. Pizza Slice button
2. Baked Potato button
3. Vegetable button
4. Custom Program
5. Cook button
6. Reheat button
7. Light
8. Changing the speed of the vent

This interface makes the common uses fairly easy except the defrosting. The menu that appears when I select deforst is very cumbersome and required a lot of trial and error to get right. The extra buttons can be confusing to a new user.

# User Interactions
I would believe that the most common sequence of actions a user does while using a microwave is:
1. Open the door
2. Place food in
3. Close door
4. Enter desired amount of cook time
5. Hit Start
6. a.Wait for timer to go off
6. b. Hit "Add 30 Seconds" to add more cook time
